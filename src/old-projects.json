This website is documentation on how to use the style framework and was build with this style framework. Sassy helps the user align items on the screen in a grid based system as well as restyle elements.</p><p>This framework is made for the user's convenience. It allows users to create more complex elements with ease, such as nav bars, dropdowns, modals, alerts, and tooltips.</p><h4>The Technical Side</h4><p>Sassy was build in SCSS, which was compiled down to CSS. This documentation for Sassy was build using itself as a way to show off how it works and its simplicity. The documentation shows an example and code for each element and layout in Sassy.</p><h4>What I Learned</h4><p>This project was my introduction to a CSS extension language. It helped me learn how and why to use SCSS as well as make me think of all of the ways I could make standard styling easier for users.</p>",
